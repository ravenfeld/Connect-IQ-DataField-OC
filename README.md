# Connect-IQ-DataField-OC
When you have to find some place and you know distance and bearing to this place from current location using your map and compass, you press Lap button to mark current location as a reference and go to the place of interest until distance and bearing on the display is equal to the desired ones.

Compass and arrow is always pointing to the real north.
